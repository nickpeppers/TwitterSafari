# TwitterSafari
Developer Demo
Twitter Safari is a simple Xamarin.Forms app that uses LinqToTwitter to search Twitter statuses. It pulls in the latest 100 statuses based on your search text, which if selected will navigate to a new screen of that Twitter users profile. The Twitter user profile displays their user information and their last 100 statuses that you can click on to share.

This is the MainPage containing an EditText to enter search parameters. Upon search it populates the below ListView with the latest statuses found, which you can click to navigate to the UserStatusPage.

This is the UserStatusPage that displays their user profile information including profile background image, user image, user location, number of followers, number of friends, number of statuses, and populates the ListView with their last 100 statuses.
